# CS61A: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

My solutions for the CS61A 2011 course from Brian Harvey at Berkeley University https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bh/61a-pages/

I found this course based on the recommendation from this website: https://teachyourselfcs.com/

I have not finished this course yet (currently at week 4), but so far I can only recommend it as it gives an very interesting high-level perspective on programming.
